My understanding of Software Quality Assurance(SQA):

I think SQA is to make sure developers develop an usable and qualified software.SQA  is to establish a planned, systematic
approach to develop a standard to ensure that the management, procedures, practices and methods can properly be applied to 
all projects. To proved it is qualified we can use lots of tools and methods.At the beginning of the project, software 
quality assurance group is involved in the establishment plan, standards and procedures.
