##How to select and sensitize path in CFT?##
The key to path sensitization is the decision or branching nodes and the associated conditions.
If all these conditions are independent of each other, then all the paths defined above
can be sensitized by selecting variable vallues to satisfy the specific conditions for each path.
If some of the conditions in a path are correlated through some shared logical or numerical
variables, then further analysis is needed to eliminate certain paths that cannot be
sensitized.
A third situation is that the conditions might be related through some computation and
assignment in between that link one variable in one condition to another one in a later
condition. The analysis of such correlated conditions is essentially an analysis of data
dependencies, which we address in Section 1 1.3 in connection to data flow testing.
