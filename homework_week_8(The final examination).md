In order to ensure the quality of a software system, the most important part is to do a good test. The major test activities include the following in roughly chronological order:

Test planning and preparation, which set the goals for testing, select an overall testing strategy, and prepare specific test cases and the general test procedure.

Test execution and related activities, which also include related observation and measurement of product behavior.

Analysis and follow-up, which include result checking and analysis to determine if a failure has been observed, and if so, follow-up activities are initiated and monitored to ensure removal of the underlying causes, or faults, that led to the observed failures in the first place.

Maybe I can set a goal for testing like this:

Through testing, to achieve the following objectives: 

Test whether the product meets the design requirements, including: whether each function is realized, and whether the business process is correct. 

Whether the operations of the product is running stable. 

Bugs and rate of defect is controled within the range of acceptable.

As to diandian, I can test if the buttons is effective, after I clicked all buttons, whether there are bugs, whether the software is running stable, and so on.

Sample test strategy document
● testing purposes :
( 1 ) the scope of the test , including what features to include and what to exclude
( 2 ) Who is the customer and the end user , who is the acceptance of test results by
( 3 ) the test sequence and schedule
( 4 ) acceptance of the conditions of success factors limit
● Resource Requirements :
What skills and experience ( 1 ) the need to plan and run the test
( 2 ) the roles and responsibilities of relevant personnel
( 3 ) Who will be the overall coordination of the test work
( 4 ) Who is responsible for test data management , version control , bug tracking
● Test environment :
( 1 ) System configuration for testing how
( 2 ) What automated tools
( 3 ) What are the test data ( database and enter the transaction ) needs, how to install
( 4 ) how to adjust the system clock before
● testing process :
( 1 ) which is running the test procedure to be followed ( settings, perform , record )
( 2 ) how to develop a test case , and what is its standard format
What ( 3 ) coverage requirements are defined test cases
( 4 ) have a problem how to determine the severity of the problem of how to deal with
