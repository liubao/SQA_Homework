In order to ensure the quality of a software system, the most important part is to do a good test. The major test activities include the following in roughly chronological order:

Test planning and preparation, which set the goals for testing, select an overall testing strategy, and prepare specific test cases and the general test procedure.

Test execution and related activities, which also include related observation and measurement of product behavior.

Analysis and follow-up, which include result checking and analysis to determine if a failure has been observed, and if so, follow-up activities are initiated and monitored to ensure removal of the underlying causes, or faults, that led to the observed failures in the first place.

Maybe I can set a goal for testing like this:

Through testing, to achieve the following objectives: 

Test whether the product meet the design requirements, including: whether each function is realized, and whether the business process is correct. 

Whether the operations of the product is running stable. 

Bugs and rate of defect is controled within the range of acceptable.
