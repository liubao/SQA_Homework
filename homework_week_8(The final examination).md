In order to ensure the quality of a software system, the most important part is to do a good test. The major test activities include the following in roughly chronological order:

Test planning and preparation, which set the goals for testing, select an overall testing strategy, and prepare specific test cases and the general test procedure.

Test execution and related activities, which also include related observation and measurement of product behavior.

Analysis and follow-up, which include result checking and analysis to determine if a failure has been observed, and if so, follow-up activities are initiated and monitored to ensure removal of the underlying causes, or faults, that led to the observed failures in the first place.
