##How to ensure the quality of a software system##
In order to ensure the quality of a software system, the most important job is to do a good test. The major test activities include the following in roughly chronological order:

Step 1：Test planning and preparation, which set the goals for testing, select an overall testing strategy, and prepare specific test cases and the general test procedure.

Step 2：Test execution and related activities, which also include related observation and measurement of product behavior.

Step 3：Analysis and follow-up, which include result checking and analysis to determine if a failure has been observed, and if so, follow-up activities are initiated and monitored to ensure removal of the underlying causes, or faults, that led to the observed failures in the first place.


As to DianDian, I can design a test like following:

1 A Software Test Plan
Firstly, according to user's needs and report on the performance of the functional requirements specification , software testing needs to define the corresponding report , namely define the highest standard of black box testing ,all future work of software testing will focus on the testing requirements. If application meets requirements, that is qualified , whereas that is unqualified ; meanwhile we also need choose test content, arrange software testers , test time and test resources appropriately.

2 software test design
The test plan developed test requirements decomposition stage , subdivided into a number of executable test process , and select the appropriate test cases for each test procedure ( test case selection will directly affect the validity of the test results ) .
3 Software Test Development
Create automated test procedure can be reused.

4 Software Test Execution
Automatic test execution test development phase created and discovered defect tracking management. Test execution generally unit testing, combinatorial testing , integration testing, system testing and regression FBI steps , testers should be based on science and responsible attitude, step by step test .

5 Software Test Evaluation
Combines quantitative field test coverage and defect tracking reports for the progress and efficiency of the quality and application software development team conducted a comprehensive evaluation .
Clearly, black box testing only in strict accordance with the steps , it may be the quality of the application checks . However , without the help of an excellent testing tool , simply by virtue of manual testing , not only to spend a lot of manpower, material and financial resources, and there are a lot of testing is difficult or even impossible to achieve.
